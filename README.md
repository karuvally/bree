The cute little batch processing engine

## What is this? 

bree is a simple batch processing engine built on KISS principles. The decision
to develop bree arose due to two main reasons. I was bored and I needed to learn
C. The completed package would work like this. You would have a master node
which does all the batch processing. You would go to a user node (eg. a laptop)
and request a job to be done (eg. a download). If there are no tasks currently
being done by the master, it would immediatlely start the download, else it
would add the job to a queue from which each tasks would be executed one by one.

## Getting Started

I don't have any idea about that at the point. Watch this space, who knows, we
might have a proof of concept in a month :D

### Prerequisites

Same as above. Literally no idea.

### Installing

Hu hu hu :D

Not possible man.
